Code to solve the 2015 AdventOfCode puzzles


http://adventofcode.com/

All code is in Python 3.

* Day 1 - No code needed, just text edit search/replace
* Day 2 - Loops over stdin, calculating areas/perimeters/etc
* Day 3 - Read/execute instructions to move Santa around.  Numpy and matplotlib (pcolor) for visualization.
* Day 4 - MD5/hashlib
* Day 5 - Validating strings against certain rules (using regex)
* Day 6 - Turning on/off 1000x1000 matrix of lights, numpy and matplotlib (pcolor)
* Day 7 - Recursive "wire" description.  Class, PrettyPrinter
* Day 8 - Regex text replacement
* Day 9 - Traveling Salesman Problem.  Tried an algorithm, but ended up just brute-forcing it.
* Day 10 - Look-and-say, text replacement via regex.
* Day 11 - "Password" (text) validation against regex rules.  Used subclassing from str for incrementing password.
* Day 12 - JSON parsing.  Part 1 only needed json-parser "parse_int" handler, Part 2 needed full tree recursion.
* Day 13 - Traveling Salesman in a different form.  Brute force again via itertools.permutations.
* Day 14 - Reindeer time simulation.  Class.
* Day 15 - Integer optimization, brute force.
* Day 16 - Matching item properties
* Day 17 - Brute-force (looping via looped itertools) searching for combinations that match target volume
* Day 18 - Game-Of-Life.  Implemented with numpy arrays within a class.  Example of iterating over numpy arrays.
* Day 19 - Rule-based text replacement (developing a "molecule").  Part 1 was straightfoward, but for Part 2 my brute-force approach didn't work, and due to a lack of analysis, I resorted to this solution:  https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/3xflz8/day_19_solutions/cy4h7ji
* Day 20 - Integer factorization.
